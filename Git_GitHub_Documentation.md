## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and coordinate work among team members. It is commonly used for:  
- **Tracking changes**: Keep a history of modifications to your code.  
- **Collaboration**: Work with others on the same codebase.  
- **Branching and merging**: Experiment without breaking your main project.  

---

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and adds additional features like:  
- **Collaboration tools**: Pull requests, issue tracking, and project boards.  
- **Code hosting**: Store your projects in public or private repositories.  
- **Integration**: Connect with CI/CD pipelines, project management tools, and more.

## Why Should Students Learn Git & GitHub? üßë‚Äçüéì  
- **Teamwork**: Collaborate on group projects efficiently.  
- **Portfolio**: Showcase your coding projects to future employers.  
- **Version Control**: Never lose your work or worry about overwriting files again.  
- **Industry Standard**: Git and GitHub are widely used in the software industry.

## Key Concepts in Git üóùÔ∏è  

1. **Repository (Repo)**: A storage space for your project, including code, files, and history.  
2. **Commit**: A snapshot of your changes, with a message describing what you did.  
3. **Branch**: A separate workspace to develop new features without affecting the main codebase.  
4. **Merge**: Combine changes from one branch into another.  
5. **Pull Request (PR)**: Propose changes to a codebase, typically reviewed before merging.  
6. **Clone**: Copy a repository from GitHub to your local machine.  
7. **Push/Pull**: Send your changes to GitHub (push) or download changes from GitHub (pull).
